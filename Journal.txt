*** DAY 1 *** (09.09.2024)
Today I've learned the basics of HTML.
HTML is HyperText Markup Language used to structure a webpage. 
HTML uses elements. 
An element is formed by opening tag, closing tag and content between them. 
Example: <p>This is a paragraph</p>.
There are also void elements (a.k.a self-closing tags). They have no content and cannot have any child nodes.
Other commonly used tags/elements are lists, links, images, divs, etc.
You can use forms and input fields to collect user information such as email, name, etc.
Tables are a great option to display data on the page.
Overall a great learning day! Keep it up!
